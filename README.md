# HyrdaCor-Project
This is my text based adventure game that I was assigned to create.
I chose to make this game using batch. The game doesn't go too in depth, but I've gotten most of the basic game features down.

I had the idea of making this a game where you could actually fight monsters in a dungeon while also following a narrative,
But I had decided that it may take too long for me to completely finish a game with as much content as I invisioned. That being said,
you may notice some elements that I had created which don't hold very much use such as the HUD showing the players health and their
inventory, and variables that I had set but never used. I decided to move away from making an RPG-like text based adventure to a more
traditional one that focuses more on feeding the imagination. I've also done my best to keep it as polished as possible. (Not entirely sure
how polished a text based game can be lol.)

Never the less, I hope you enjoy what I've put together!
