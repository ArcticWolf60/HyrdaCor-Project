Please make sure that all of these core files are
in the same directory,(EX: Desktop or folder) or else you will encounter problems.
To start one of the game modes simply open the launcher, there you can select what
mode you'd like to play as well as tweak some options and customize your experience.
 
NOTE: The only way to open the game is through the launcher so don't try to open
any of the other files, it won't work. (If you ever have problems loading the launcher,
just delete the "launcher_options.bat" file and it should work again. Messing with the
window size of the launcher can also cause some complications.)


:Dev's Notes:
I sort of got caught up in wanting to make my own game so I didn't really add all that much onto the
text based sort of adventure that I had started originally. Instead I ended up losing sight of that
and started making two other games that were in the same universe as the text based adventure game.
I spent a long time making these games and put a lot of work into them, however these games are
now pretty much finished and I made a launcher to bring them all under one roof for ease of access
(Also just because I was being a bit experimental).
Now that I've gotten those games out of the way I can start continuing the story for the text based game.

Have fun playing! :)
